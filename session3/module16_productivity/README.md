# Module 16: Terminal Productivity

**Duration:** 15 minutes

## Learning Objectives

In this final module, you will learn tips, tricks, and tools to make your time in the terminal faster and more efficient. This includes mastering your command history, creating shortcuts with aliases, and using a terminal multiplexer to manage persistent sessions.

## Key Tools and Techniques

| Technique | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `history` | Reuse and manipulate previous commands. |
| `alias` | Create shortcuts for longer commands. |
| `screen` | A terminal multiplexer to manage persistent sessions. |
| Keyboard Shortcuts | Navigate and edit the command line quickly. |
| `.bashrc` | A configuration file to make your settings permanent. |

## Exercises

### Part 1: Mastering Your History (4 minutes)

Your shell remembers every command you type. Learning to access this history efficiently is a huge productivity boost.

**Practice:**

1.  **View history:**

    ```bash
    history | tail -n 10 # See the last 10 commands
    ```

2.  **Execute previous commands:**

    ```bash
    !!     # Execute the very last command
    !ls    # Execute the last command that started with 'ls'
    ```

3.  **Reverse Search:** Press `Ctrl+R` and start typing any part of a previous command. Keep pressing `Ctrl+R` to cycle through matches. Press `Enter` to execute or `Ctrl+G` to cancel.

### Part 2: Creating Shortcuts with `alias` (4 minutes)

Aliases are custom shortcuts for commands you use frequently.

**Practice:**

1.  **Create a temporary alias:**

    ```bash
    alias ll=\'ls -lahF\'
    ll # This now runs 'ls -lahF'
    ```

2.  **Make it permanent:** To keep your aliases, add them to your `~/.bashrc` file.

    ```bash
    echo "alias ll=\'ls -lahF\'" >> ~/.bashrc
    echo "alias gs=\'git status\'" >> ~/.bashrc

    # Reload the configuration to apply changes
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```

### Part 3: Persistent Sessions with `screen` (7 minutes)

`screen` is a terminal multiplexer that allows you to keep sessions active even after you disconnect. This is **essential** for running long processes on remote servers.

**Practice:**

1.  **Start a new `screen` session:**

    ```bash
    screen -S my_session
    ```

2.  **Run a long-running command** inside the screen session:

    ```bash
    sleep 300
    ```

3.  **Detach from the session:** Press `Ctrl+A` followed by `d`. You are now back in your original terminal, but the `sleep` command is still running inside the detached session.

4.  **List running sessions:**

    ```bash
    screen -ls
    ```

5.  **Reattach to your session:**

    ```bash
    screen -r my_session
    # You will see the sleep command is still running (or has finished).
    ```

6.  **To exit a screen session,** simply type `exit` in the shell.

#### Key `screen` Commands

All `screen` commands are prefixed with `Ctrl+A`.

| Command | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Ctrl+A`, `d` | **D**etach from the current session. |
| `Ctrl+A`, `c` | **C**reate a new window within the session. |
| `Ctrl+A`, `n` | Go to the **n**ext window. |
| `Ctrl+A`, `p` | Go to the **p**revious window. |
| `Ctrl+A`, `"` | List all windows. |

## Congratulations!
